<!-- Thanks for learning about sustainability at Pitt. , where you'll use code to process and share your experiences with others. While you are exploring sustainable design, gather pictures and data you'll use in this document.

To get started making this document, you'll need to download the zip file from GitHub. Go ahead and put these files in a secure folder where you can find them and organize assets like files and images. You'll also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "CodePad" on Chromebooks. Open the index.html document in the text editor and we can get started building our own webpage.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these hidden HTML code comments be, or delete them.-->

<!--First, we'll need to do some work in the head of the document. The head organizes important information needed to explain to browsers how the website works. You can keep the title of this HTML document, "My Nature Outing," or change it to whatever you want to call it. Your new text will appear in your browser tab-->

<!--We'll begin by thinking about the mode of seeing and the medium of photography. Seeing is just one way we come to understand our world. And when we use tools for seeing, like telescopes and microscopes, we can sometimes see an object differently from how we might otherwise. Sometimes we can bring the object closer, sometimes we can better frame the object, and sometimes we can bring different elements into focus. In this exercise we are going to think about how we can frame not the whole of the tree, but the branch, not the boulder, but the moss on its northern-most side. We might be in a big place, but we can use the lens to direct our attention to something smaller. So what are the parts that make up the whole of this system?-->

<!--In this exercise we'll need to place our image assets in the project folder making sure each image is a .jpg or .png. Link the img src=to your image in your project folder. Then you'll need to scroll down to the corresponding modals at the bottom of this document to add the image there as well. The modal will pop-up when the audience activates the link. Finally, be sure to add an alt= description for visually impaired audiences-->

    <h2>Bikes</h2>
    <p>My favorite sustainable design is bikes. Bikes are a good method of transportation that dont't use gas and reduces traffic on the streets. The more people we get riding bike, the less air polution we have in the world. Also bikes are fun. We could make biking even more efficiant by adding more bike lanes througout the streets so that their are less accidents.</p>

      <img src="img2.jpg" style="width:50%">
      <p style="color:black"><p>Pollinator Gardens have plants that polliators can easily get to and pollinate. How it works is that people plant plants that atract pollinators and gives them an easy way to pollinate. Its important because a lot of bees are dying right now and they are really important in our ecosystem. They provide 75-90% of our fruits and vegetables. A way we could inprove this is by having a larger amount of Pollinator Gardens so more bees could pollinate and survive.  </p></p>

<!-- Modal 2-->

  <div class="modal-content">
    <span class="close">&times;</span>
        
    <p style="color:black">Rain Gardens collect water and drain it so that places and sewers don't get flooded. What happends is that the plants in the garden absorb the rain water so that the large amount of it doesn't go into the sewer system, flood it, and pollute the rivers. Its important becuause Pittsburgh has a lot of rain and if we had no Rain Gardens, all the water would go into the sewers and flood them. Then that
    polluted water would go into the rivers and contaminate them and the things that live in them. We could inprove this by making the size of the gardens bigger so they can absorb more water.

    <p style="color:black"><p>Trees canopys reduces temperatures. The Arbor Day Foundation report that trees can reduce 2-4 degrees Fahrenheit. This is important because more people die from heat stroke than from cold exposure each year. Increasing the number of trees we have in the city is going to be important because the world is getting hotter from climate change so the more trees, the less hot its going to be.
