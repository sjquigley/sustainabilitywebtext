<!-- Thanks for learning about sustainability at Pitt. , where you'll use code to process and share your experiences with others. While you are exploring sustainable design, gather pictures and data you'll use in this document.

To get started making this document, you'll need to download the zip file from GitHub. Go ahead and put these files in a secure folder where you can find them and organize assets like files and images. You'll also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "CodePad" on Chromebooks. Open the index.html document in the text editor and we can get started building our own webpage.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these hidden HTML code comments be, or delete them.-->

<!--First, we'll need to do some work in the head of the document. The head organizes important information needed to explain to browsers how the website works. You can keep the title of this HTML document, "My Nature Outing," or change it to whatever you want to call it. Your new text will appear in your browser tab-->

  <!--this next section of code is the <head>. The <head> tells browsers what your page should look like on the different kinds of screens and links stylesheets that control the appearance of your content. Whenever see a "class" called, you can see that element styled on the style.css page.-->

<!--We'll begin by thinking about the mode of seeing and the medium of photography. Seeing is just one way we come to understand our world. And when we use tools for seeing, like telescopes and microscopes, we can sometimes see an object differently from how we might otherwise. Sometimes we can bring the object closer, sometimes we can better frame the object, and sometimes we can bring different elements into focus. In this exercise we are going to think about how we can frame not the whole of the tree, but the branch, not the boulder, but the moss on its northern-most side. We might be in a big place, but we can use the lens to direct our attention to something smaller. So what are the parts that make up the whole of this system?-->

<!--In this exercise we'll need to place our image assets in the project folder making sure each image is a .jpg or .png. Link the img src=to your image in your project folder. Then you'll need to scroll down to the corresponding modals at the bottom of this document to add the image there as well. The modal will pop-up when the audience activates the link. Finally, be sure to add an alt= description for visually impaired audiences-->
