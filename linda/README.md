## Get Started (Chromebook)

1. Go to repository [Sustaianble Design repository:] (https://github.com/MyNatureOuting/sustainable-design)

2. Click "Code" then "Download ZIP" to your local computer. 

3.	Find and open the “sustainable-design-main-zip” file in “Files/Downloads” and drag this folder into “MyFiles.”   

4.	Name this project folder with your first name. You will return to this folder to manage your scripts and other assets like images, pdfs, etcetera.

5.	Use **Code Pad Text Editor** to open the index.html documents from your project folder. If needed, download [Code Pad Text Editor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/code-pad-text-editor/adaepfiocmagdimjecpifghcgfjlfmkh?hl=en-GB)

6.	Start working with code by reading through the index.html where you'll find instructions on how to build your own web text!

7.	Once you have modified content and transferred your assets to your project file, you will want to publish to the web. GitHub provides a good solution for "free." Create a GitHub account, then create a new repository for this webtext. Click "uploading an existing file," (push) your files into this repository. You'll need ALL of your assets to make your webtext function properly. Upload assets, then hit "Commit changes."

8.	Now go to your repository "settings." Scroll down to "GitHub Pages" and change the setting from "none" to "main." Hit "Save"

9.	This will provide you with a published GitHub URL.

10.	Test the URL in a browser. Magic, no? Actually, it's computer science.
