    <h2>YOUTH AND THE COMMUNICATION OF SCIENCE</h2>
       <p>Since the first volume of Le Journal des Sçavans on January 5th, 1665, the diffusion of scientific knowledge has largely followed the same linear progression. It begins with the scientists, those experts who hypothesize, gather data, form knowledge, and publish their findings. Next, this knowledge is abstracted and disseminated to the public by mediators and powerbrokers, i.e., journalist, politicians, educators, business entities, even movie stars. Science communicators have long referred to this linear progression as the deficit model of science communication, in that it assumes scientist have the tools, bone fides, and authority the public lack. But over the last thirty years, the field of science communication, aided by social epistemic theory and ethnographic methods, has come to understand the public and their scientific knowledge and interests in greater complexity (Burns 2003), as more “active, knowledgeable, playing multiple roles, receiving as well as shaping science” (Einsiedel 2007, p. XX). This is not to say that in the years since, the deficit model has been wholly upended (Trench, 2008) or that scientist play a diminished role in the formation of scientific knowledge (Cortasa 2016). Rather, what we can claim, is that our understanding of what constitutes science communication has broadened. For example, Trench and Bucci (2021) theorize science communication along a continuum of modes, models, and applications ranging from exclusive to inclusive: on one end, they locate the aforementioned deficit model and other top-down approaches, and on the other, bottom-up participatory models encouraging the public to take part in both the formation and communication of scientific knowledge through activities like citizen science. Between these polls, they place dialogic models meant to engage the public in inquiry, discussion, and deliberation. To further their framework, the authors challenge science communicators to examine both the injustice and inequity inherent these models and each model’s efficacy “in terms of how, and how much, a given practice or set of practices stimulate wider conversation.” For strategic, ethical, and legal reasons, we should also consider where do our youth fit on such a continuum?</p>
        
      <p>There are many reasons why we should prioritize youth in science communication. We should start by recognizing that children have a powerful ability to influence one another in areas of science participation (Breakwell & Beardsell, 1992) and environmental activism (Wallis 2021). Children also have the ability to influence adults, as demonstrated by the “Greta Thunberg Effect” (Sabherwal et al, 2021); the eponymous phenomenon explaining how individuals of various ages are more likely to participate in collective action against climate change after having heard Thunberg’s message. Science communicators have also recognized youths’ ability to leverage social media, especially around issues related to environmental justice. Belotti et al. (2022) document how youth climate activist use a range of social media tools and tailor messages for specific users to build networks to achieve a variety of organizational, educational, and political goals related to climate action. Recognizing this skill, other scholars believe scientists should work more directly with youth to create social media messaging, build consensus, and deliver policy targets (Eide, E., & Kunelius, R. 2021). Science communication strategy is especially important in the area of environmental sciences, where attitudes about the environment range wildly and medium plays an important role in whether or not individuals choose to listen. Bolin & Hamilton (2018).</p>
        
      <p>Taking a different line argument, Mergoza and Jenkins (2013) see the inclusion of children in the communication of science as an ethical imperative because children will pay the greatest price for or our current science policies and practices. They challenge science communicators to develop new dialogic models of science communication that center youth and their own exigencies as they relate to environmental science and policy. “Through such an approach, science in the perception of young people can indeed become a tool to design a world as close as possible to the world in which they would like to live, rather than external knowledge that a child just needs to learn in order to live in whatever world is proposed to him or her” (p.3). And still others emphasize the legal reasons for doing so; Welty and Lundy’s (2013) “voice model for involving youth in decision making” cites the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) which codified a child’s right to “scientific and technical knowledge” (article 28) and the right to form and “express […] views freely in all matters affecting the child, the views of the child being given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child” (Article 12) and “The child shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of the child's choice” (Article 13). Working from these first principles, Welty and Lundy advocate for the empowerment of our youth as active participants in shaping policies and practices that affect their lives and underscore the pivotal role of science education and communication methods play in this process. Every child, they argue, has a right to:</p>
      
      
      <div>
        <ol>
          <li>Space – safe and inclusive opportunity to form and express a view</li>
          <li>Voice – facilitated to express views freely in medium of choice</li>
          <li>Audience – the view must be listened to</li>
          <li>Influence – the view must be acted upon</li>
        </ol>
      -Welty and Lundy 2013, p.2
      </div>
         
  <p>Following Welty and Lundy’s voice model, this research adopts a hybrid approach to creating an inclusive science communication experience for our youth that includes spaces for dialogic inquiry, tools for voicing this knowledge, and opportunities for children to circulate their findings to their audience, and thus the opportunity to influence policy.</p>

    <h3>DIALOGIC COMMUNICATION TOOLS</h3>
       <p>Science communication researchers have demonstrated that youth, and individuals generally, are more likely to internalize environmental knowledge through dialogic models () than from deficit models. Generally speaking, dialogic science communication seeks to bridge the gap between experts and the public through both the communication and formation of scientific knowledge. A sociocultural approach to knowledge formation emphasizes the dynamic interaction between individuals and their cultural and social contexts in the construction and transmission of knowledge. Rooted in the early twentieth century work of Vygotsky (1978) and his theory of sociocultural development, this approach views knowledge as co-constructed through social interactions within specific cultural settings. It recognizes that individuals are not passive recipients of knowledge, but active participants in its creation and dissemination. Linell (2009) notes that active participation, what we refer to as dialogic communication, is how ‘human beings generally make sense of the world in meaning making activities mediated in and through language’’ (p.XX). However, the dialogic model of science communication does not result in a simple exchange of knowledge occurring in a specific moment in space and time. Rather, we should, as researchers and interlocutors, understand it as inherently complex, yet fecund. As McGreavey et al argue (),  “Approaching communication as a complex system means that our interventions are always incomplete because human interactions are recursively guided by context-specific structures and processes that are always in a state of becoming” (p.XX).  The complexity of human dialogue requires iteration; interlocutors must engage with and consider the knowledge and perspectives of others and reassert or reorganize their thinking based on a given exchange. Dialogic communication, as an active communication strategy, also requires a great deal of effort and accountability from all parties. Participants and organizations engaged in dialogue must yield control while opening themselves to uncertain outcomes and other risks (Kent, M. L., & Taylor, M. (2002).</p>
        
        <p>Dialogic science communication theory and methods naturally overlap with research in the field of education, which focuses more narrowly on how learners actively engage with both educators and peers through meaningful dialogue. Some of this research focuses both on teacher-centered learning spaces where science instructors use inquiry to bridge cognitive divides (Mortimer and Scott 2003, ), decenter authority (Scott, P., & Ametller, J. (2007),  assess student knowledge (Mercer, N., Dawes, L., & Staarman, J. K. 2009) while others favor the dialogic as means of empowering students, giving each the tools to initiate and facilitate meaningful dialogue on their own. Driver et al. (2000), for example present the case for teaching argument to promote scientific norms in the secondary science classroom. Argument, they say, mirrors how scientists, themselves, construct knowledge. While they briefly discuss argument as “debate,” they see argument more as an inclusive tool to give students voice in the classroom. They define “argument” broadly, explaining it as an individual and collective act, taking many forms including written and spoken, all contributing to a discourse that builds over time. They say that in addition to helping students understand the social epistemic nature of science, argument prepares students for civic engagement. They feature Toulmin’s (1958) work on argumentation as a framework for understanding how argument occurs in specific instances, but caution that understanding argumentative structure does not necessarily assist students in assessing the value of the actual scientific data. Here, they seem to be saying that teaching argumentation also requires educators to teach the kinds of critical thinking skills needed to analyze, assess and communicate data. Other researchers see the value of teaching Toulmin more strategically, as a “patterns” students can use to analyze and structure scientific arguments and engage with the ideas of others through “dialogical argumentation” (Erduran, S., Simon, S., & Osborne, J. 2004). In the first case, the researchers promoted Toulmin argument patterns (TAP) to help students structure conversations around science topics. In the second case, they required students use TAP while working in small groups more akin to debate. In this case, students were asked to acknowledge and incorporate their interlocutor’s argument within their own by way rebuttal. The work of Frijters et al (2008) demonstrates that debate strategies requiring students to take a specific position on an issue are highly effective in building critical thinking skills and science knowledge in youth. However, they also warn of its overuse,  in that all human interaction, especially debate, requires a great deal of energy. Their research discovered that the more students engaged in debate, the less they liked this mode of instruction.  This sustainable design research project is similarly interested in the using argument to structure dialogic engagement, but less interested in defining argument as adversarial or debate oriented. Because of the exploratory, co-creative nature of our project, we see the value of using stasis theory as a tool for both guiding inquiry and structuring arguments. A range of ancient rhetoricians contributed to stasis theory and its application from Aristotle and Hermagoras in Ancient Greece to Cicero and Quintilian in Ancient Rome (Crowley, S., & Hawhee, D., 1999). Modern rhetorician have similarly addressed the use of stasis theory in science contexts (Fahnestock, J., & Secor, M. 1988) and in engineering more specifically (Lane, 2022). This latter research suggests stasis theory can equip engineering students with a “framework of critical analysis [that] can help to turn a host of conflicting claims and multiple uncertainties into an ordered process of problem solving” (p.3). Greek stasis theory involves four questions, that of: conjecture (Where does this occur?), definition (What is it?), quality (Why is it important?), and policy (What should we do?). Davis (1996) argues that stasis theory is a valuable tool for inquiring into a topic (judicial rhetoric), making judgements (epideictic rhetoric), and forming policy (deliberative rhetoric). This research project will similarly explores how we might apply stasis theory as a tool for promoting dialogic communication in deliberative learning and making spaces.

  <div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
    <h3>DATA COLLECTION AND DELIBERATIVE MAKING</h3>
       <p>Data collection, analysis, and judgement figure prominently in the first three questions of stasis theory: conjecture: (Where does this occur?), definition (What is it?), and quality (Why is it important?). They also align with Dewey’s understanding of human beings as innately curious for knowledge and thus predisposed to do the work of science. Dewey, and the empiricist who followed him, believe that due to human curiosity, individuals learned best through direct engagement with scientific phenomena by deductively or inductively observing, testing, and reasoning (68-72) and that without such lines of inquiry, life would be nonsensical. “All knowledge, all science, thus aims to grasp the meaning of objects and events” Dewey 1933; 2022 p.117). It’s no wonder that constructivist related methods including inquiry and problem-solving have their origins in Dewey’s work (Johnston, J. S. (2013). Similarly, many crowd sourcing apps like “Cornell Bird Lab,” “iNaturalist,” and “Seek” invite the user to investigate nature and even collaborate in the data collection process. In the case of iNaturalist, the app offers opportunities for the user to share location data, media files, and record “observations” in significant detail. While some researchers see digital media as a tool for advancing citizen science, others note that not all crowd sourcing apps contribute significantly to the formation of knowledge. For example, Roche et al (2020) argue that those who design citizen science tools must prioritize environmental knowledge along with data collection as user experience goals. In addition to collecting data, apps that afford users the ability to analyze their data especially in relation to other user data will do the most to allow individuals to make judgements and form knowledge. It is also important to think about how explicitly these tools address questions of deliberation. If these apps do not afford opportunities for communicative engagement with other users, we should consider how use of these apps correlates with engagement elsewhere, in virtual and actual spaces. In addition to data collection and analysis, this project is interested in creating a deliberative workshop space and empowering students with tools to make their voices heard. For Sennet (2012), a deliberative workshop space allows for divergent thinking processes so that each might learn from the knowledges and skills of others. Rather than seeing craft as stagnant, Sennet imagines a creative synergy emerging in a shared workshop space, but also dialogic communicative practice, where different theories and methods are practiced, discussed, and judged alongside one another. A deliberative workshop space fosters creativity, knowledge, and practice that would not be possible if we worked independent of one another. Like Bussey (2023), we hope to use such a workshop space to develop a “communicative praxis […] as a platform for joint construction of meaning around sustainability practices as well as for co-creation of knowledge and practices that could enhance our capability to act and navigate wicked sustainability issues” (p.50).
