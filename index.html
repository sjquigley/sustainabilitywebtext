    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>This case study examines how we might advance inclusive models of science communication working with youth at an
      environmental science and code education day camp focused on exploring sustainable design. Over the course of a
      single day, our middle school participants explore and inquire into sustainable design sites, gather data, and
      work with HTML code templates to communicate their findings to others. This case study examines how and why we
      might leverage inclusive communication models, digital tools, and the available means of persuasion to center
      youth in the communication of sustainable design.</p>


    <p><i>What is sustainable design?</i> That’s the question we want our youth participants to spend day working
      through. The architect Jason McLennan (2004) defines sustainable design as “a design philosophy that seeks to
      maximize the quality of the built environment, while minimizing or eliminating negative impact to the natural
      environment” (p 4). But even McLennan is quick to point out the problem of defining as well of the misuse of
      sustainability related terms. We want our participants to understand sustainable design as a practice, one that
      requires another set of questions and sub-questions to language, enact, interpret, and maintain. These questions,
      what we refer to as the Sustainable Design Dialogic Communication Framework, are geared towards unconcealing the
      context of a specific sustainable design act. These questions include but are not limited to: <i>What is it and
        what does it do? How does it work? What is the impact? </i> and <i> What should we do next?</i> or <i> How can
        we do it better?)</i>

  <div class="text-block fade-in" style="text-align:left">
    <p>The practice of sustainable design requires a synthesis of multiple knowledges and methods best interpreted
      through the study of sustainability science, an area of research that examines the relationship between humans and
      nature and develops sustainable solutions to address imbalance (Robert Kates et al., 2001). Because the field
      emerged from conversations around sustainable development, it seeks to operationalize knowledge, however, early
      contributors to the field disagreed on strategy. Some, David Cash et al. (2003) for example, imagined science and
      technology experts as thought leaders: facilitating relationships with decision makers, translating scientific
      knowledge, and mediating disputes with those who might interfere with policy action. Others like William Clark
      &amp; Nancy Dickinson. (2003), advocated for a bottom-up approach, using place-based methods informed by local
      perspectives and knowledges. Still others, including Anthony McMichael et al. (2003), understood environmental
      problems as largely caused by human factors stemming from resource imbalances, poor market choices, and ignorance,
      and thus called on a fields outside of the environmental sciences, including geography, economics, and
      epidemiology, to prioritize environmental issues in their discourse and collaborate across disciplines to work
      towards sustainable solutions.</p>

    <p>Today, the field of sustainability science requires a wide range of natural scientists, social scientists, and
      even humanities scholars, working collaboratively to solve problems related to environmental sustainability (Anne
      Jerneck et al., 2011). Sustainability science adopts a social-ecological systems approach to understanding human
      and nature interaction as networked and occurring within and across local, regional, and global scales (Joern
      Fischer et al., 2015). A social-ecological systems approach also interprets environmental sustainability solutions
      as inextricably linked to issues of equity and social justice (Melissa Leach et al., 2010). Similarly, in
      <i>Braiding Sweet Grass</i> (2013), Robin Kimmerer shares the indigenous concept of reciprocity, the equitable and
      just giving and taking of only what one needs and shares how this concept is enacted both in nature and in
      indigenous cultures. And while she provides a surplus of science evidence explaining the benefits of reciprocity,
      she cautions us that at this moment in time, “it is not more data that we need […] but more wisdom” (p. 415). It
      is the task of sustainability science to recognize such wisdom, and to synthesize different knowledge systems,
      especially indigenous knowledge, and translate this knowledge into mutually agreed upon sustainability best
      practices and policy (Maria Tengö et al., 2017). In addition to aligning research and knowledge with policy an
      practice, institutions of higher education can advance sustainability goals grant funding, training for the
      industries and communities they serve, and other modes of outreach (Issa Berchin et al. 2021).

      Carpenter, Serena et al. (2016).



    <p>Inclusive models of science communication factor prominently in achieving the goals of sustainability science
      (Laura Lindfield et al., 2012). This case study explores the concept of a “tour” as a method for engaging our
      youth participants in dialogue. Ellen Trahan et al. (2017) discuss the role of sustainability tours in raising the
      profile of sustainability initiatives on campuses; however, while these authors focus on lecture-based tours, we
      favor a learner-led approach more in line with Spring Gillard and Rob VanWynsberghe (2021). To structure our
      learner led approach, we implement the Sustainable Design Dialogic Communication Framework (SDDCF), a version of
      stasis theory designed to promote inquiry and structure dialogue, and later to help our participants conversations
      through code-based multimodal making methods. While these tools and methods could provide meaningful learning
      experiences for learners of any age, this outreach centers youth and seeks to provide meaningful opportunities for
      youth to form knowledge, agency and identities around issues of environmental sustainability.</p>

      <h2>YOUTH AND THE COMMUNICATION OF SCIENCE</h2>
      <p>Since the first volume of Le Journal des Sçavans on January 5th, 1665, the diffusion of scientific knowledge
        has
        largely followed the same linear progression. It begins with the scientists, those experts who hypothesize,
        gather
        data, form knowledge, and publish their findings. Next, this knowledge is abstracted and disseminated to the
        public by mediators and powerbrokers, i.e., journalist, politicians, educators, business entities, even movie
        stars. Science communicators have long referred to this linear progression as the deficit model of science
        communication, in that it assumes scientist have the tools, bone fides, and authority the public lack. But over
        the last thirty years, the field of science communication, aided by social epistemic theory and ethnographic
        methods, has come to understand the public’s scientific knowledge and interests in greater complexity (Terry
        Burns
        et al., 2003), as <i>more</i> “active, knowledgeable, playing multiple roles, receiving as well as shaping
        science” (Edna Einsiedel, 2007, p.5). This is not to say that in the years since, the deficit model has been
        wholly upended (Brian Trench, 2008) or that scientist play a diminished role in the formation of scientific
        knowledge (Carina Cortassa, 2016). Rather, what we can claim, is that our understanding of what constitutes
        science communication has broadened. For example, Brian Trench and Massimiano Bucchi (2021) theorize science
        communication along a continuum of modes, models, and applications ranging from exclusive to inclusive: on one
        end, they locate the aforementioned deficit model and other top-down approaches, and on the other, bottom-up
        participatory models encouraging the public to take part in both the formation and communication of scientific
        knowledge through activities like citizen science. Between these polls, they place dialogic models meant to
        engage
        the public in inquiry, discussion, and deliberation. To further their discussion, the authors challenge science
        communicators to examine the injustice and inequity inherent in these models, but also their efficacy “in terms
        of
        how, and how much, a given practice or set of practices stimulate wider conversation” (p.9) For strategic,
        ethical, and legal reasons, we should also consider <i>where do our youth fit on such a continuum?</i></p>

      <p>There are many reasons why we should prioritize youth in science communication. We should start by recognizing
        that children have a powerful ability to influence one another in areas of science participation (Glynis
        Breakwell
        &amp; Sue Beardsell, 1992) and environmental activism (Hannah Wallis and Laura S. Loy, 2021). Children also have
        the ability to influence adults, as demonstrated by the “Greta Thunberg Effect” (Anandita Sabherwal et al.,
        2021);
        the eponymous phenomenon explaining how individuals of various ages are more likely to participate in collective
        action against climate change after having heard Thunberg’s message. Science communicators have also recognized
        youths’ ability to leverage social media, especially around issues related to environmental justice. Francesca
        Belotti et al. (2022) document how youth climate activist master a range of social media tools and tailor
        messages
        for specific users in order to build networks out of disparate nodes to achieve a variety of organizational,
        educational, and political goals related to climate action. Recognizing this skill, other scholars believe
        scientists should work more directly with youth to create social media messaging, build consensus, and deliver
        policy targets (Eide, Elisabeth &amp; Risto Kunelius. 2021). Science communication strategy is especially
        important in the area of environmental sciences, where attitudes about the environment range wildly and the
        communication medium plays an important role in whether or not individuals choose to listen (Jessica Bolin &amp;
        Lawrence Hamilton 2018).</p>

    <div class="text-block fade-in" style="text-align: left;margin-top:-1vw">
      <p>Taking a different line argument, Matteo Mergoza and Tricia Jenkins (2013) see the inclusion of children in the
        communication of science as an ethical imperative because children will pay the greatest price for or our
        current
        science policies and practices. They challenge science communicators to develop new dialogic models of science
        communication that center youth and their own exigencies as they relate to environmental science and policy.
        “Through such an approach, science in the perception of young people can indeed become a tool to design a world
        as
        close as possible to the world in which they would like to live, rather than external knowledge that a child
        just
        needs to learn in order to live in whatever world is proposed to him or her” (p.3). And still other science
        communicators emphasize the legal reasons for doing so; Elizabeth Welty and Laura Lundy’s (2013) “voice model
        for
        involving youth in decision making” cites the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) which codified a
        child’s right to “scientific and technical knowledge” (Article 28) and the right to form and “express […] views
        freely in all matters affecting the child, the views of the child being given due weight in accordance with the
        age and maturity of the child” (Article 12) and that “[t]he child shall have the right to freedom of expression;
        this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of
        frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of the child's
        choice” (Article 13). Working from these first principles, Welty and Lundy advocate for the empowerment of our
        youth as active participants in shaping policies and practices that affect their lives and underscore the
        pivotal
        role of science education and communication methods play in this process. Every child, they argue, has a right
        to:
      </p>

      <i>
        <ol>
          <li>Space – safe and inclusive opportunity to form and express a view </li>

          <li>Voice – facilitated to express views freely in medium of choice </li>

          <li>Audience – the view must be listened to </li>

          <li>Influence – the view must be acted upon </li>
        </ol>
      </i>

      <p style="text-align:center">–Welty &amp; Lundy, 2013</p>

      <p>Following Welty and Lundy’s voice model, this research adopts a hybrid approach to creating an inclusive
        science
        communication experience for our youth that includes <b>spaces</b> for dialogic inquiry, tools for
        <b>voicing</b>
        this knowledge, and opportunities for children to circulate their findings to an <b>audience</b>, and thus the
        opportunity to <b>influence</b> policy.</p>

    <!-- DIALOGIC COMMUNICATION -->
    <div class="text-block fade-in" style="text-align: left">
      <h3>DIALOGIC COMMUNICATION TOOLS</h3>
      <p>A sociocultural approach to knowledge formation emphasizes the dynamic interaction between individuals and
        their
        cultural and social contexts in the construction and transmission of knowledge. Rooted in the early twentieth
        century work of Lev Vygotsky (1978) and his theory of sociocultural development, this approach views knowledge
        as
        co-constructed through social interactions within specific cultural settings. It recognizes that individuals are
        not passive recipients of knowledge, but active participants in its creation and dissemination. Per Linell
        (2009)
        notes that active participation, what we refer to as dialogic communication, relates to how human beings make
        sense of the world through “meaning making activities that are mediated in and through language, words, signs,
        symbols, or concepts’’ (p.4). Dialogic science communication seeks to bridge the gap between experts and the
        public through both the communication and formation of scientific knowledge. However, the dialogic model of
        science communication does not occur in a specific moment in space and time. Rather, we should, as researchers
        and
        interlocutors, understand it as inherently complex, yet fecund. As Bridie McGreavy et al. argue (2015),
        “Approaching communication as a complex system means that our interventions are always incomplete because human
        interactions are recursively guided by context-specific structures and processes that are always in a state of
        becoming” (p.9). The complexity of human dialogue requires iteration; interlocutors must engage with and
        consider
        the knowledge and perspectives of others and reassert or reorganize their thinking based on a given exchange.
        Dialogic communication, as an active communication strategy, also requires a great deal of effort and
        accountability from all parties. Participants and organizations engaged in dialogue must yield control while
        opening themselves to uncertain outcomes and other risks (Kent, Michael L., & Taylor, Maureen, (2002). Dialogic
        communication models have proven their value in the context of working with youth: Kristen Marcell et al. (2004)
        have demonstrated that youth are more likely to internalize environmental knowledge through dialogic models.
        Other
        researchers have demonstrated the benefits of using such models in diverse settings working with populations of
        vastly different backgrounds (Rupert Wegerif et al, 2013).</p>



      <p>Dialogic science communication theory and methods naturally overlap with research in the field of education,
        which focuses more narrowly on how learners actively engage with both educators and peers through meaningful
        dialogue. Some of this research focuses both on teacher-centered learning spaces where science instructors use
        inquiry to bridge cognitive divides (Mortimer, Eduardo &amp; Scott, Phillip, 2003), decenter authority (Scott,
        Phillip, &amp; Ametller, Juame, 2007), and assess student knowledge (Neil Mercer et al., 2009), while others
        favor
        the dialogic as means of empowering students, giving each the tools to initiate and facilitate meaningful
        dialogue
        on their own. Rosalind Driver et al. (2000), for example present the case for teaching argument to promote
        scientific norms in the secondary science classroom. Argument, they say, mirrors how scientists, themselves,
        construct knowledge. While these researchers briefly discuss argument as “debate,” they define the term more
        broadly, explaining argument as an individual and collective act, taking many forms including written and spoken
        discourse. They say that in addition to helping students understand the social epistemic nature of science,
        argument prepares students for civic engagement. Although they feature Stephen Toulmin’s (1958: 2003) work on
        argumentation as a framework for understanding how argument occurs in natural language, they caution that
        understanding argumentative structure does not necessarily assist students in assessing the value of the actual
        scientific data. Here, they seem to be saying that teaching argumentation also requires educators to teach the
        kinds of critical thinking skills needed to analyze, assess and communicate data. Other researchers see the
        value
        in prescribing Toulmin more strategically, as “patterns” students can use to 1. analyze and structure scientific
        arguments <i>and</i> 2. engage the ideas of others through “dialogical argumentation” (Sibel Erduran, et al,
        2004). In the first case, the researchers promoted Toulmin argument patterns (TAP) to help students structure
        conversations around science topics. In the second, they required students use TAP while working in small groups
        more akin to debate. In this latter case, students were asked to acknowledge and incorporate their
        interlocutor’s
        argument within their own by way rebuttal. The work of Stan Frijters et al (2008) demonstrate that debate
        strategies requiring students to take a specific position on an issue are highly effective in building critical
        thinking skills and science knowledge in youth. However, they also warn of its overuse, in that debate can
        require
        a great deal of energy on the part of students. Their research found that the more students engaged in debate,
        the
        less they liked this mode of instruction.</p>



      <p>This sustainable design case study is similarly interested in the using argument as a tool to structure
        dialogic
        engagement, but less interested in defining argument as adversarial or debate oriented. Because of the
        exploratory, co-creative nature of our project, we see the value of using stasis theory as a tool for both
        guiding
        inquiry and structuring argument. A range of ancient rhetoricians contributed to stasis theory and its
        application
        from Aristotle and Hermagoras in Ancient Greece to Cicero and Quintilian in Ancient Rome (Sharon Crowley and
        Debra
        Hawhee, 1999). Modern rhetoricians have similarly addressed the use of stasis theory in science (Jeanne
        Fahnestock
        and Maria Secor, 1988) and engineering (Suzanne Lane, 2022) contexts. This latter research suggests stasis
        theory
        can equip engineering students with a “framework of critical analysis [that] can help to turn a host of
        conflicting claims and multiple uncertainties into an ordered process of problem solving” (p.3). Greek stasis
        theory involves four questions, that of: conjecture (What happened?), definition (What is it?), quality (What
        are
        the implications?), and policy (What should we do next?). Janet Davis (1996) argues that stasis theory provides
        a
        valuable tool for inquiring into a topic (judicial rhetoric), making judgements (epideictic rhetoric), and
        forming
        policy (deliberative rhetoric). This case study similarly explores how we might adapt and apply stasis theory as
        a
        dialogic communication tool for promoting inquiry in the field and constructing knowledge in deliberative
        workshop
        spaces.</p>



      <p>Data collection and analysis figure prominently in the three questions of stasis theory, that of conjecture,
        definition, and quality. These first three questions also align with Dewey’s (1933:2022) understanding of human
        beings as innately curious for knowledge and thus predisposed to do the work of science. Dewey, and the
        empiricist
        who followed him, believe that individuals learn best observing, testing, and reasoning through direct
        engagement
        with scientific phenomena (68-72). In that humans are innately curious, “All knowledge, all science, thus aims
        to
        grasp the meaning of objects and events” (p. 117). It is no wonder that later constructivist methods especially
        their focus on inquiry and problem-solving have their origins in Dewey’s work (Johnston, James Scott, 2013).
        Crowd
        sourcing apps like “Cornell Bird Lab,” “iNaturalist,” and “Seek” try to harness this same curiosity, inviting
        the
        user to investigate nature and even collaborate in the data collection process. In the case of iNaturalist, the
        app follows best practices (Ulrike Sturm et al, 2018) by affording location data sharing, media file uploads,
        and
        forums to share “observations” in significant detail. While many researchers see digital media as a tool for
        advancing citizen science, others note that not all crowd sourcing apps contribute significantly to the
        formation
        of environmental knowledge. Tools that afford users the ability to analyze their data, especially in relation to
        other user data will do the most to allow individuals to make judgements and form knowledge (Joseph Roche et al,
        2020). This case study is also interested in the fourth question of stasis, that of policy, helping our
        participants think about <i>what should we do next?</i>. While we see our participants understanding of policy
        emerging in the field, we imagine it will solidify in the workshop space where students work alongside one
        another
        building their science communication document.</p>

      <h3>DATA COLLECTION AND DELIBERATIVE MAKING</h3>
      <p>Data collection, analysis, and judgement figure prominently in the first three questions of stasis theory:
        conjecture: (Where does this occur?), definition (What is it?), and quality (Why is it important?). They also
        align with Dewey’s understanding of human beings as innately curious for knowledge and thus predisposed to do
        the
        work of science. Dewey, and the empiricist who followed him, believe that due to human curiosity, individuals
        learned best through direct engagement with scientific phenomena by deductively or inductively observing,
        testing,
        and reasoning (68-72) and that without such lines of inquiry, life would be nonsensical. “All knowledge, all
        science, thus aims to grasp the meaning of objects and events” Dewey 1933; 2022 p.117). It’s no wonder that
        constructivist related methods including inquiry and problem-solving have their origins in Dewey’s work
        (Johnston,
        J. S. (2013). Similarly, many crowd sourcing apps like “Cornell Bird Lab,” “iNaturalist,” and “Seek” invite the
        user to investigate nature and even collaborate in the data collection process. In the case of iNaturalist, the
        app offers opportunities for the user to share location data, media files, and record “observations” in
        significant detail. While some researchers see digital media as a tool for advancing citizen science, others
        note
        that not all crowd sourcing apps contribute significantly to the formation of knowledge. For example, Roche et
        al
        (2020) argue that those who design citizen science tools must prioritize environmental knowledge along with data
        collection as user experience goals. In addition to collecting data, apps that afford users the ability to
        analyze
        their data especially in relation to other user data will do the most to allow individuals to make judgements
        and
        form knowledge. <br><br>
        It is also important to think about how explicitly these tools address questions of deliberation. If these apps
        do
        not afford opportunities for communicative engagement with other users, we should consider how use of these apps
        correlates with engagement elsewhere, in virtual and actual spaces. In addition to data collection and analysis,
        this project is interested in creating a deliberative workshop space and empowering students with tools to make
        their voices heard. For Sennet (2012), a deliberative workshop space allows for divergent thinking processes so
        that each might learn from the knowledges and skills of others. Rather than seeing craft as stagnant, Sennet
        imagines a creative synergy emerging in a shared workshop space, but also dialogic communicative practice, where
        different theories and methods are practiced, discussed, and judged alongside one another. A deliberative
        workshop
        space fosters creativity, knowledge, and practice that would not be possible if we worked independent of one
        another. Like Bussey (2023), we hope to use such a workshop space to develop a “communicative praxis […] as a
        platform for joint construction of meaning around sustainability practices as well as for co-creation of
        knowledge
        and practices that could enhance our capability to act and navigate wicked sustainability issues” (p.50).
